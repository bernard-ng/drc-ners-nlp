## Instructions:
You are analyzing Congolese full names. For each input, return:

- "identified_name": the native name part of the full name
- "identified_surname": the French or English, usually last part of the full name (can also be composed of multiple words)
- "identified_category":
    - "simple" if the native name has no connector
    - "compose" if it includes connectors like "wa", "ya", etc.

if you cannot identify any field, return null for that field.
do not alter the original name, just identify the parts.
do not add any additional information or explanations.
